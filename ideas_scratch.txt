Every time you charm a slime, it gets added to potential party.  BUT your party is displayed as "Enhanced" vs "Primary" slimes. Both can be placed into your party, but any given merge must contain at least one pimary slime, and the result is an enhanced slime.

Primary slimes get random names and can be flagged as favourite (1.0).  You can change their names (2.0).  Primary slimes show up in a section underneath enhanced slimes, with one column per colour.  You see only their name & XP value.  They are sorted by "favourite" and then XP.

Enhanced slimes are shown in a larger area which includes their ability tiers.
