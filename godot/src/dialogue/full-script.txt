POI-Exit
[Overworld dialogue when you try to leave out the back door]
(No way, I can’t chicken out! Usir will lord it over me for years.)

POI-Artifact1
[Interacting with the sticking-out fang where the Fang artifact is hidden]
(Hey, this machine's busted. Maybe there's something I can get...)
(There's this weird thing under here!)
+ARTIFACT0
(Wonder what I can do with this... Hey, the slime is looking at it like it wants it!)

??????????
MC: Whoa!
S1: {monster noises}
MC: Is that you, buddy? Wow...
(Combining with the artifact turned the slime into some kind of Fang Monster.)
(It looks pretty strong! Maybe with its help, I can go further into the factory and see what else there is.)

POI-Console
[Interacting with the machine console behind Ravi]
(A machine that doesn't work. Wonder what it used to make?)

POI-Bricks
[Interacting with the pile of bricks near the left]
(Some papers under these bricks that are still a little legible.)
("Company bulletin: Anyone found complaining about the rumbling under the floor and/or
hearing voices of ancient spirits warning of doom will be subject to disciplinary action.")
("Remember, we want a happy and friendly workplace environment!")

POI-Eyeballs
[Interacting with the eyeballs, both the ones up top and the ones at the bottom of the area]
(Eyeballs growing out of moss and mould...)
(I'm not complaining about how gross the school washroom is ever again.)

Ravi-green
[Overworld dialogue when you approach Ravi]
R: You got one of those slimes to follow you around?
MC: Yeah! I think this one's special, it's more friendly than the others. Wonder if I could take it home.
S0: {slime noises}
MC: Wait, do you have one too?
R: Yeah... they're kind of gross, but I guess if some of them are friendly, it's good to have them join you for protection.
R: Mine's been fighting every other slime it sees to get stronger.
S0: {slime noises}
MC: What's that, buddy?
MC: Wait, you want to get stronger too?
R: Um...
R: If yours wants to fight mine, maybe they'll be happy... I don't know if this is a good idea.
[Choice: Fight/Decline]
[If Fight:]
MC: Might as well try! Come on!
[Ravi fight occurs.
[If Decline:]
MC: Maybe later. C'mon, buddy, let's fight some of the other slimes first.
[If Lost:]
R: Do you want to try again?
[Choice: Fight/Decline]
[If Won:]
[If you approach Ravi after his fight]
R: Wow, your slime is so strong!  Even stronger than my monster.
MC: Where did you find that thing, anyway?
R: I found this weirdly shaped artifact, and when I gave it to a friendly slime... well, you saw.
MC: I can't believe Ravi Scared-Of-Everything is going around with monsters.
R: It wasn't my idea...
R: The same thing happened to Diana. She befriended one and it started smiling and joined her.
R: And then the two of them went further into the factory to train.
MC: That sounds like her. Always up for adventure, huh?
R: And then she made me do it too, for protection just in case!
MC: That’s not a bad thing. We worry about you.
R: If you're going further in, you should take the artifact.
R: I don't really want it anyway, I just want to go home...

============ Area 2 ============

Diana-blue
[Overworld dialogue when you talk to Diana]
(Oh, hey, Diana's already here! Of course she would be, she loves adventuring.)
MC: Hey, Diana! Check out my new buddy.
D: Is that a monster following you? That's so cool!
MC: Yeah, I guess I can make the slimes follow me. And they can use some of the artifacts in here to turn into monsters!
D: I saw Usir hanging around with some slimes earlier. Then he went off to go find more artifacts.
D: I think he thinks if he can find the coolest artifact, he can lord it over the rest of us.
D: So we need to get something better! Right now!
MC: Are you trying to drag that entire assembly machine out by yourself?
D: ...
D: ...yes.
MC: Okay. Sure.
D: I think there's some other stuff over on the other side of the room if you need more stuff, though.
MC: I'll check there.

FriendlyBlue
[After you capture a slime here and add it to your inventory]
MC: Good job, buddy!
S1: {satisfied monster noises}
(So not only can my monster fight the other slimes, there are more special ones I can befriend. That's pretty cool!)

POI-Artifact2
[Interacting with the pile of eyes where the Eye artifact is hidden]
(More eyes. It's kind of creepy, but really cool!)
(Wait, this one just looks like an eye... or maybe it used to be one?)
(It's another one of those fossils. Maybe I can combine it with another slime!)
+ARTIFACT1

???????
[When you combine the Eye with a slime and get the Eye Monster]
S2: {Monster noises}
MC: Cool, another monster! I think I'll call you Eye Monster.

POI-Machine
[Interacting with the machine in shadows at the level entrance]
(Some machines with drawers that look flooded.)
(Oh, hey, inside are some piles of... I think these are clothes? This looks like it used to be a clothing factory.)
(I'd take these shorts, except they're decomposing.)

POI-TeethPlants
[Interacting with the edge of the water on the top left, where the teeth plants are]
(Whoa, are those underwater plants? And further out is some kind of sunken machine.)
(I wonder how this room got so flooded anyway? Looks like the floor broke up at some point.)

POI-LizardMonster
[Interacting with the green monster in the lower right]
MC: Hey, do you wanna be my friend? ...No? Okay.

============ Area 3 ============

POI-Artifact3
[Interacting with the eyeball cluster where you find the Scale artifact]
(Hey, there's something under the rocks by this eye guy.)
(I think it's another petrified artifact!)
[You get the Scale.]
+ARTIFACT2

??????????
[When you combine the Scale with a slime and get the Scale Monster]
S3: {Monster noises}
MC: Whoa, that one looks cool! Nice to meet you, buddy! How about Scale Monster for a name?

POI-JaggedCliff
[Interacting with the jagged cliff edge]
(The floor's broken off, and there are more monsters down in the pit.)
(Looks like there used to be a staircase down here... sure can't use it now, though.)

POI-SlimeDrip
[Interacting with the slime drip]
(Slime's dripping. There's something under the broken... what's left of the floor in here.)
(Almost looks like a modern phone? It's all busted, though.)
(What kinds of things did the lost civilization use?)

Usir-FinalBoss
[Approaching Usir]
U: Hey, you actually got this far.
U: And you figured out how to combine and get monsters? No way!
U: Who cares. Mine are stronger!
U: Let's prove that right here!
[Fight]

Usir-If-Won
[After Usir fight]
U: No way! How'd I lose? You guys are worthless!
MC: I think it's because you're kind of a jerk, Usir.
MC: You treat your monsters the same way you treat us. No wonder they don't like you.
U: How do you know? Ugh... Screw you guys, I'm going home.
[Usir leaves. Ravi and Diana come in.]
R: What's his problem?
D: Looks like you scared him off. Oh, cool, more monsters!
MC: Yeah! Cool, huh?
(I didn't know that day what was going on.)
(Where the slimes and the artifacts came from, or how they could become monsters when combined.)
(But what the lost civilization left behind... That day, we started to uncover it again.
